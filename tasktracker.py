#i have no idea how to do any of this but let's go i guess
import json

print("hey hi welcome")

# okay so first off json files, how do they work
# worked with like coded in databases before so writing functions and stuff should be okay
# never used a json file or separate database thing before tho so we're gonna firstly try to set this up

# okay after reading i think i get it now
# when first starting the program we want to prompt user if they have an external json file that they want to load in, otherwise create a new one
# cli time

#print("first off, do you have an external json file you would like to load? use [some command - load (file)], otherwise create a new one with [some command - start]")

start_file = {

}

# if something something
#with open("task_tracker.json", mode="w", , encoding="utf-8") as write_file:
#    json.dump(start_file, write_file)
# creates a new task tracker json file (hopefully!)


#with open("task_tracker.json", mode="r", encoding="utf-8") as read_file:
#       task_tracker_data = json.load(read_file)
# loads task tracker json file (if there already is one) and creates a variable "task_tracker_data" for it
# not sure how to handle the name of the file if it isn't already "task_tracker.json"...

# break time
